# First-time Usage of "Image Sharpening"
This is a simple tutorial aimed at assisting merchants in using Image Precision AI for image optimization for the first time, taking approximately 10 minutes to complete. The complete operational steps are outlined below, with each operation's details explained separately.

## Step 1: Access the "Enhance Product Images" Page
Click on the Shopify Apps menu and navigate to the entrance of "Enhance Product Images". Upon first entry, the list page will display a prompt indicating no tasks. Then click on "New Image Enhancement" or "Select Images" in the top right corner to enter the task creation page.

## Step 2: Access the "New Image Enhancement Task" Page
On this page, the system will retrieve all package images.

The search bar supports simple searches, but the "Product" input box requires the complete product name and does not support fuzzy searches. For example, entering "Skirt" and then clicking "Search" will result in no matches.

You must enter the complete product name, such as "1# Skirt - Image provided by upstream supplier," to find matches. This limitation is due to Shopify's product query functionality, which we are working to improve for future support of fuzzy searches.

## Step 3: Confirm Images

The dialog box is divided into two parts: 

### Left side of the dialog box
The selected images are displayed again for your review and confirmation. Each image has an "x" in the upper right corner to deselect it. Clicking on an image enlarges it for viewing.

### Right side of the dialog box
This section allows you to modify the Title, Image Enhancement Method, Image Zoom, and Replace Image options. The functions of these fields are explained below:

| Function | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Title | Allows merchants to distinguish between multiple tasks; different names have no impact on tasks |
| Image Enhancement Method | If your images are cartoons, please select the second option "Cartoon Images Only"; otherwise, use the default "General" |
| Image Zoom | Magnification factor; options include: Auto, No Zoom. Auto rules: images with the longest side between 10 ~ 500 are magnified 4 times, between 500 ~ 1000 are magnified 2 times, and between 1000 ~ 4096 remain the same size. No Zoom means no magnification |
| Replace Image | Indicates whether to replace existing product images with AI-processed new images, with the default option selected. If selected, upon task completion, the package images will be automatically deleted and replaced with the new images. Therefore, it is recommended to click "Download Selected Images" below to download selected images for backup each time a new task is added, so that these old images can be used for restoration in case of problems. If not selected, you will need to download the AI-generated new images on the task details page, as we only keep them for a maximum of 7 days |
| Balance | Balance |
| Image Quantity | Quantity of images |
| Cost | Cost |
| Submit | Submit task button; click this button when you confirm completion |
| Download Selected Images | Download selected images |
| Wallet Recharge | Redirect to the wallet recharge page |

### Click Submit
When you click the "Submit" button to submit the task, if the balance is insufficient, you will be prompted to recharge. Click "Recharge" to go to the wallet recharge page. After recharging, return to this page in your browser and click "Close" and then "Submit" directly without refreshing the page to reselect images.

Of course, you may encounter other errors, which will be displayed as Toast messages. If you encounter any issues that cannot be resolved, please click on the chat window in the bottom right corner to contact us.

## Step 4: Image Enhancement Records
At this point, the task has been successfully added, and it is now queued for execution. On this page, you can view detailed information about the task, execution logs, and the results of image processing. If the task is still in progress, the page will automatically retrieve results every 10 seconds. After the task is completed, click "Download All" under "New Image" to download all AI-generated images. If you selected automatic replacement of product images when adding a new task, immediately check the product page to confirm if the images have been sharpened.
